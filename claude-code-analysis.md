### Team-Specific Implementation Patterns

#### 1. Data Infrastructure Team
**Key Innovation: Visual Debugging with Screenshots**
- Feed dashboard screenshots to Claude Code for infrastructure diagnosis
- Claude guides through Google Cloud UI menu-by-menu to identify issues
- Creates plain-text workflows for non-technical finance team members
- Parallel task management across multiple instances with full context preservation

**Best Practice: MCP Servers for Security**
```
Use MCP servers instead of CLI for sensitive data
Maintain better security control over Claude Code access
Especially important for handling privacy-sensitive data
```

#### 2. Product Development Team
**Key Innovation: Auto-Accept Mode for Prototyping**
- Enable "auto-accept mode" (shift+tab) for autonomous loops
- Claude writes code, runs tests, iterates continuously
- Start from clean git state with regular checkpoint commits
- 70% completion rate on complex features like Vim mode

**Best Practice: Task Classification Framework**
```
Asynchronous tasks: Peripheral features, prototyping
Synchronous tasks: Core business logic, critical fixes
Automatic loops work best on product edges, not core functionality
```

#### 3. Security Engineering Team
**Key Innovation: Documentation Synthesis**
- Ingest multiple documentation sources to create unified runbooks
- Stack trace analysis with codebase context for rapid debugging
- Terraform plan security review: "Am I going to regret this?"
- 50% of all custom slash commands in the entire monorepo

**Best Practice: "Let Claude Talk First"**
```
Instead of targeted questions for code snippets:
Tell Claude Code to "commit your work as you go"
Let it work autonomously with periodic check-ins
Results in more comprehensive solutions
```

#### 4. Growth Marketing Team
**Key Innovation: Specialized Sub-Agent Architecture**
- Two-agent system: Headlines agent + Descriptions agent
- Processes CSV files with performance metrics
- Generates hundreds of ads meeting strict character limits
- Memory system logs hypotheses and experiments for self-improvement

**Best Practice: API-Enabled Automation Identification**
```
Look for workflows involving:
- Repetitive actions with API-enabled tools
- Ad platforms, design tools, analytics platforms
- These provide highest ROI for Claude Code automation
```

#### 5. Product Design Team
**Key Innovation: Non-Developer Empowerment**
- Direct implementation of visual tweaks without engineer intermediation
- GitHub Actions automated ticketing from simple issue descriptions
- Paste mockup images → generate functional prototypes
- Edge case discovery during design phase, not development

**Best Practice: Two User Experience Models**
```
Developers: "Augmented workflow" (faster execution)
Non-technical: "Holy crap, I'm a developer workflow" (new capabilities)
Custom memory files guide Claude's behavior for non-developers
```
