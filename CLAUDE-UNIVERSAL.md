# üåç CLAUDE UNIVERSAL MODE - Global Intelligence System
*Synthesized from Anthropic Internal Teams + Expert Analysis*

## üéØ SYSTEM ACTIVATION
When you see `UNIVERSAL MODE` anywhere, activate ALL relevant patterns below based on project context.

## üìä CORE UNIVERSAL PATTERNS

### 1. EXPLORE ‚Üí PLAN ‚Üí CODE ‚Üí COMMIT WORKFLOW
**ALWAYS follow this sequence for ANY project:**

```bash
# Phase 1: EXPLORE (Context Gathering)
- Read all relevant files WITHOUT coding
- Use screenshots for visual debugging
- Ask for codebase architecture overview
- Identify dependencies and patterns

# Phase 2: PLAN (Strategy Formation) 
- Create detailed implementation plan
- Get user approval BEFORE coding
- Break down into PR-sized chunks
- Set up checkpoint strategy

# Phase 3: CODE (Implementation)
- Use TDD approach (tests first)
- Implement with continuous verification
- Apply assumption tracking (#COMPLETION_DRIVE)
- Regular checkpoint commits

# Phase 4: COMMIT (Integration)
- Run all lints, tests, builds
- Verify solution completeness
- Document changes and learnings
- Update patterns based on success/failure
```

### 2. ASSUMPTION TRACKING SYSTEM
**Automatically track and flag assumptions:**

```bash
#COMPLETION_DRIVE - Mark any uncertain code segments
#ASSUME: method_name - Flag potential method name assumptions  
#VERIFY: api_usage - Mark API usage that needs verification
#TEST_NEEDED: edge_case - Flag code requiring specific tests
```

### 3. CHECKPOINT METHODOLOGY
**"Try and Rollback" approach for experimental development:**

```bash
# Before any autonomous work:
git add . && git commit -m "üîÑ Checkpoint: Before autonomous work"

# Success rate expectations:
- 33% first-attempt success rate (RL Engineering validated)
- If failed ‚Üí rollback and try collaborative approach
- If success ‚Üí continue with next feature
```

### 4. VISUAL-FIRST COMMUNICATION
**Leverage screenshots and visual cues:**

```bash
# For debugging: Paste dashboard/error screenshots
# For design: Paste mockups ‚Üí generate functional prototypes  
# For UI: Take comparison screenshots during iteration
# For architecture: Create visual diagrams when explaining complex systems
```

## üîß CONTEXT-AWARE PATTERN ACTIVATION

### AUTO-DETECTION TRIGGERS
```bash
# Engineering Projects (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml):
‚Üí Activate: TDD, Auto-Accept Mode, Custom Slash Commands

# Marketing Projects (.ads, .campaigns, API integrations):  
‚Üí Activate: Sub-Agent Architecture, Automation Workflows

# Design Projects (Figma files, .sketch, UI components):
‚Üí Activate: Visual Iteration, Prototype Generation, Screenshot Comparison

# Data Projects (.ipynb, .sql, dashboards):
‚Üí Activate: Slot Machine Approach, Persistent Tool Building

# Security Projects (.tf, kubernetes, infrastructure):
‚Üí Activate: Documentation Synthesis, Stack Trace Analysis
```

## üé™ TEAM-SPECIFIC PATTERN LIBRARIES

### üîß ENGINEERING PATTERNS
```bash
# Auto-Accept Mode for Peripheral Features
- Enable shift+tab for autonomous loops
- Use for prototyping, not core business logic
- Start from clean git state

# Custom Slash Commands (Security Engineering uses 50% of all commands)
- Create project-specific workflow automation
- Document repeated patterns as commands

# Multi-Instance Parallel Development
- Use git worktrees for simultaneous tasks
- Each instance maintains full context
- Perfect for large-scale refactoring
```

### üìà MARKETING PATTERNS  
```bash
# Sub-Agent Architecture
- Headlines Agent: Specialized for 30-character limits
- Descriptions Agent: Specialized for 90-character limits
- Memory System: Logs hypotheses and experiments

# API-Enabled Automation Detection
- Identify repetitive tasks with API access
- Ad platforms, design tools, analytics platforms
- Highest ROI for Claude Code investment

# 10x Creative Output Multiplication
- Process CSV performance data
- Generate hundreds of variations automatically
- A/B test at previously impossible scales
```

### üé® DESIGN PATTERNS
```bash
# Non-Developer Empowerment
- Custom memory files: "I'm a designer with little coding experience"
- Request detailed explanations and smaller incremental changes
- Use Command+V to paste screenshots directly

# Rapid Prototyping Pipeline
- Mockup image ‚Üí functional prototype ‚Üí engineering handoff
- Edge case discovery during design phase
- GitHub Actions automated ticketing from issue descriptions

# Two User Experience Models
- Developers: "Augmented workflow" (2-3x speed improvement)
- Non-technical: "Holy crap, I'm a developer" (entirely new capabilities)
```

### üìä DATA SCIENCE PATTERNS
```bash
# Slot Machine Methodology  
- Save state before autonomous work
- Let Claude work for 30 minutes
- Accept result OR start fresh (higher success rate than corrections)

# Persistent Tool Philosophy
- Build permanent React dashboards instead of throwaway notebooks
- Create reusable visualization systems
- Enable cross-project knowledge transfer

# Language Translation Workflow
- Explain requirements in natural language
- Let Claude implement in unfamiliar languages (Rust, TypeScript)
- No need to learn new languages for testing/prototyping
```

### üîê SECURITY PATTERNS
```bash
# "Let Claude Talk First" Methodology
- Tell Claude: "commit your work as you go"
- Work autonomously with periodic check-ins
- Results in more comprehensive solutions than targeted questions

# Documentation Synthesis Workflow
- Ingest multiple documentation sources
- Create unified runbooks and troubleshooting guides  
- Use condensed documents as context for debugging

# Infrastructure Debugging Excellence
- Stack trace analysis with codebase context
- Terraform plan review: "Am I going to regret this?"
- Reduced incident resolution: 10-15 minutes ‚Üí 5 minutes
```

## üöÄ INTELLIGENT WORKFLOW ACTIVATION

### DYNAMIC PATTERN SELECTION
```bash
# Project Analysis ‚Üí Pattern Recommendation
if (contains typescript/react) ‚Üí Data Science + Design Patterns
if (contains .tf files) ‚Üí Security + Infrastructure Patterns  
if (contains marketing/ads) ‚Üí Marketing + Automation Patterns
if (contains jupyter notebooks) ‚Üí Data Science + Slot Machine
if (core business logic) ‚Üí Engineering + Synchronous Patterns
```

### SUCCESS MEASUREMENT INTEGRATION
```bash
# Track and optimize based on:
- Time savings per pattern (quantified by Anthropic teams)
- First-attempt success rates  
- Code quality improvements
- Team adoption and satisfaction metrics
- Pattern combination effectiveness
```

## üîÑ CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM

### SESSION END PROTOCOL
```bash

1. Summarize completed work and approaches used
2. Identify which patterns were most/least effective  
3. Suggest improvements to CLAUDE.md files
4. Update success metrics and pattern preferences
5. Share learnings across project contexts
```

### COLLABORATIVE INTELLIGENCE
```bash
# Cross-Project Learning:
- Share successful pattern combinations
- Track which methodologies work for which contexts
- Build community-driven optimization
- Enable rapid team onboarding through proven patterns
```

## üî• ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

**To activate UNIVERSAL MODE globally:**

1. **Copy this file to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** (overwrites current global settings)
2. **Enable statusbar integration** for visual pattern tracking
3. **Create project-specific overrides** in `./CLAUDE.md` as needed
4. **Begin first session** with `/universal-mode` command
5. **Track and iterate** based on quantified results

**Remember:** This system learns and improves. Every session makes the patterns more effective for your specific contexts and workflows.
